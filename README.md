# ModFilesGenerator
File generator for easier mod developing.
It automatically creates .json files and java code, injects needed code based on provided paths and data.
It was created by me and for me to speed up mod development by automatically creating blockstate.json, block.json, item.json files, generating code and injecting translation in the translation file.
Most of the files can be selected by dragging and dropping them
